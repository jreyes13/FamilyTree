# Family Tree Project  

This repository hosts a **family tree** in [GEDCOM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM), a widely used standard for exchanging genealogical data between different software and online platforms.  

The idea is simple: by keeping this tree open and version-controlled on GitHub, anyone in the family (or collaborators) can view it, suggest improvements, and help grow an accurate and rich family history.

## üìÇ What is GEDCOM?  
**GEDCOM (GEnealogical Data COMmunication)** is a plain text file format created specifically for storing genealogical data. It allows:  
- **Compatibility** ‚Äì import/export between different genealogy programs and websites.  
- **Portability** ‚Äì the same file can be used with a wide range of tools.  
- **Transparency** ‚Äì the content can be read, edited, or versioned like any other text file.  

This makes GEDCOM the best way to preserve and share a family tree across generations.

## üå≥ Why a Family Tree?

- **Collaboration** ‚Äì multiple relatives can contribute knowledge, stories, and corrections.  
- **Visualization** ‚Äì allows you to see how different branches connect and grow over time.  
- **Research** ‚Äì provides a foundation for exploring historical records, DNA matches, and archives.
